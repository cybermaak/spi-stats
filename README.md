# Stats Monitor for Raspberry Pi Display

This project provides system monitoring stats displayed on a Raspberry Pi with an SPI display, using [pibox-framebuffer](https://github.com/cybermaak/pibox-framebuffer) service for rendering PNGs on ST7789 displays.

**Inspiration:** 

I have a KubeSail PiBox  which is still a nice Raspberry Pi enclousre, but its echo system became obelese with the retirement of the KubeSail project ([PiBox docs here](https://docs.kubesail.com/pibox/) and this is ([wayback link](https://web.archive.org/web/20250919190846/https://docs.kubesail.com/pibox/) in case the docs also die)). 

After reflashing the Pi, I couldn't find a decent of box solution for displaying stats on the enclosures ST7789 display, hence this project. I forked https://github.com/kubesail/pibox-framebuffer to wrap it into a deployable Docker container, then created this project to have a docker stack for displaying stats on the LCD.

I started from this [Adafruit 1.3" Color stats example](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-1-3-color-tft-bonnet-for-raspberry-pi/python-stats-example), but ended up using the `pibox-framebuffer` because the relying on the Python based SPI driver was causing display to flicker.

This is how the stats looks like:

Major parts of the code were vibed with [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/) based on my own "inspirational" 🙂 instructions. I still had to spend a day worth of effort to clean up after Kiro and fix docker issues that it seemed clueless to tackle.

Parts of this README.md is also generated by Kiro in case you found it a bit cheesy.

## Architecture

- **pibox-framebuffer**: Runs as a separate Docker container from `ghcr.io/cybermaak/pibox-framebuffer:latest` on port 2019
- **stats.py**: Python script that collects system stats and sends them to the framebuffer service via HTTP

## Quick Start

### Run the Complete Stack

```bash
./run.sh
```

This will:
1. Pull the latest pibox-framebuffer image
2. Build and start both services using docker compose
3. Display system stats on your SPI display

### Stop Services

```bash
./stop.sh
```

## Development

### Local Development

To run stats.py locally (useful for development):

```bash
./run-local.sh
```

This assumes pibox-framebuffer is already running on localhost:2019.

### Build Only

To just build the stats Docker image:

```bash
./build.sh
```

## Manual Commands

### Start pibox-framebuffer only

```bash
sudo docker run -d --privileged --name pibox-framebuffer -p 2019:2019 \
  --device /dev/mem:/dev/mem \
  --device /dev/gpiomem:/dev/gpiomem \
  --device /dev/spidev0.0:/dev/spidev0.0 \
  --device /dev/spidev0.1:/dev/spidev0.1 \
  ghcr.io/cybermaak/pibox-framebuffer:latest
```

### Run stats container only

```bash
sudo docker run --rm --network host stats:latest
```

## Monitoring

### View Logs

```bash
# View pibox-framebuffer logs
sudo docker compose logs -f pibox-framebuffer

# View stats logs
sudo docker compose logs -f stats

# View all logs
sudo docker compose logs -f
```
